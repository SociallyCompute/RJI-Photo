## How do we determine labels
#### Aesthetic Labels
- Could we possibly use fuzzy set theory to determine membership?
    - Prompt users to determine if an image is good/bad/mediocre/etc.
    - Create labels from these values 
- Labels are difficult to determine because there is no standard (human perception of "good", "bad", etc)
- We might be able to match files to edited files? Is there enough edited files for the training data size?
    - ~40 photoshoots/photographer and anywhere from 100-1000 images per shoot in the dump files
    - ~100 edited images
#### Technical Labels
- We can use total pixel count/clarity?
