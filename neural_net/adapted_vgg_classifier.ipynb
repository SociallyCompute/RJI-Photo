    "### Image Quality Assessment\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "**1:** Read in all the images from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2:** Break the images into smaller categories. This can be accomplished via a K-Means classifier or possibly by running the images through a different CNN beforehand. These categories are then stored and used later. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3:** Determine labels based on the metadata stored in the pictures. For many of the 2017 pictures there is exif, IPTC, and XMP. The differences are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* exif - Stored by camera at the time of the picture. This includes GPS location, pixel count, zoom, etc.\n",
    "* IPTC - Metadata added via an editor. This is generally an older bulk metadata system. While still used it is getting phased out by XMP.\n",
    "* XMP - Metadata that can be applied as an \"xml\"-like file or added in headers and footers of images. It is more clearly defined than IPTC and significantly newer. It also allows for more metadata to be stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "For both IPTC and XMP, they contain information we can use as labels. We have preference tags (code 221) where information has been stored determining which pictures have been preferenced before our work began. In addition to this, the Reynolds Journalism School has informed us that they have color classed about half of the images via PhotoMechanic which is stored in the IPTC and XMP data. These color classes correspond to a quality assessment on a rough range of 0-9. Once labels have been determined we can begin training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4:** Import VGG-16. This is a very successful pretrained classification model that has shown promise in previous studies attempting similar techniques as us, most notibly NIMA (Neural IMage Assessment) by the perceptron team at Google.AI in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5:** Once the pretrained model has been imported we can pull the fully connected component off the top and replace it with our own. Initially we will replace it with one total classifier to determine quality but after proof of concept has been established we can supply two different classifiers (1 for technical assessment and 1 for aesthetics). These classifiers shall be constant for each category of picture while just changing the loaded weights for the system. This allows us to adjust our idea of what quality is based on the category it is in. \n",
    "\n",
    "**6:** After the models have provided a technical and aesthetic score we can use the Choquet Integral to aggregate the data together and get a measurement of uncertainty. This shall provide us with a rating and a range both of which can be used to rank photos in a set. "
