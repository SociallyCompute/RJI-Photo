    "### Reading and Interpreting Metadata\n",

    "There is a lot of data stored in each of the images. It is stored in 3 types of metadata extensions. They are:\n",
    "1. XMP\n",
    "2. Exif\n",
    "3. IPTC\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we mostly care about the color classes and whether images are \"tagged\" or not we need edited in data. This data is supplied using Photomechanic or Photoshop and looks different to an image. Because Exif is the data the camera collected at the time the picture was taken, this means that this data is stored in the XMP and IPTC data. IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council) Metadata is an older varient where XMP is newer and can be stored either in a sidecar file or in the image itself. This may make a difference as we work backward in year over our images. But starting in 2017, XMP is easier to work with so we will use it as the baseline. Metadata tags look like the following:\n",
