## Metadata Info

### Three types of Metadata
In each of our images there are 3 types of metadata stored. They are:
1. Exif
2. IPTC
3. XMP
Exif is provided by the camera during the time the picture is taken, IPTC is provided via the editor but generally older and can hold less info than XMP. XMP is what we are primarily using for our labeling scheme and to pull the linguistic variables out of the metadata.
